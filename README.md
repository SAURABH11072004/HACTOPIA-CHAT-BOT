[Problem Statement Title]:  Design and Develop an AI-Powered Chatbot for PCCOE
Description:
This project involves the design and development of an AI-powered chatbot for Pimpri Chinchwad College of Engineering (PCCOE). The chatbot uses Flask, natural language processing (NLP), and a mock database to answer user queries related to the college, such as admissions, scholarships, and courses.

Features:
Web-based chatbot interface for user interaction.
NLP-based query processing.
Simulated responses using a mock database containing PCCOE-related information.
Intelligent fallback responses powered by the NLP model when information isn't available in the mock database.
Tech Stack:
Flask: For managing HTTP requests and serving the chatbot interface.
Transformers (NLP): To handle user queries and generate intelligent responses.
Mock Database: A simulated database to store basic information related to the college.
Rasa: Used for advanced NLP capabilities in handling chatbot conversations.
